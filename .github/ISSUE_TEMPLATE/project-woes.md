## The Project
A brief description of project goals as they are relevant to your issue.

## The Issue
Describe the problem you’re trying to solve

### The goal
What should be happening? What is the expected or desired behavior?

### The problem
What is happening instead? This is similar to Canvas posts in previous semesters. Describe the problem, including relevant information like:
  [] Screenshots
  [] Code snippets
  [] Error messages
  [] Run times (for performance issues)

We may be able to solve your problem from this information alone. You are also welcome and encouraged to comment on your classmates’ issues, which will count towards participation credit.

### Prior attempts
What have you tried so far? What happened? Be specific.

### System info
Hopefully we won’t need any of this, but sometime problems are related to:
  [] Operating system and version
  [] Python version (```$ python —version```)
  [] Package versions (```$ conda list``` or ```$ pip freeze```)
  [] RAM
  [] Number of CPUs
  [] available disk space
